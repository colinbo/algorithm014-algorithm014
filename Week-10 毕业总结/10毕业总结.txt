Summary of the Study

This is a good opportunity to learn and repeat the algorithm theories and practices systematically.

Instead of solving the problems in the most basic ways, which costs much more time and efforts, we could try different data structures or algorithms to enhance our application.

We could pick a suitable data structure, which fits the best for our scenarios. We could use a hash map, which is the most time efficient, if we want to query an element with the least time.

With the dynamic programming, we are able to construct solutions with all kinds of possibilities, till the solution is found.

BFS and DFS provide the transversing ways to look for the solution.

When we solve a problem in leetcode, do go to the international sites and read the highly voted solutions and explanations.

Imitate the solutions from others and repeat them at least five times, until you master it deeply in your brain.

Join the community of geek time, and study with others for the whole lifetime.
